# Abstract

The Coffee Ordering System is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to modernize the traditional café purchasing experience by facilitating seamless digital transactions. As the demand for remote and contactless ordering solutions grows, this project aims to bridge the gap between customers and coffee shops through an intuitive digital interface that simplifies menu browsing, customization, and secure payment processing.

The application was built utilizing a robust architecture comprising React.js for the dynamic frontend and Node.js with Express for the server-side logic, supported by a MySQL relational database for structured data management. The development process involved implementing secure user authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT), designing a responsive user interface optimized for various devices, and creating distinct role-based access controls for customers and administrators. Key technical challenges addressed included managing persistent shopping carts across sessions and ensuring real-time order status updates to keep users informed.

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates the practical application of modern web technologies to streamline business operations in the food service sector. The result is a scalable, efficient platform that not only enhances user convenience but also provides shop owners with powerful tools for inventory and order management, highlighting the distinct advantages of adopting digital solutions over manual processes in small-scale retail environments.
