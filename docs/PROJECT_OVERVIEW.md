# Project Overview

## 1. Description
The Coffee Ordering System is a full-stack web application designed to digitize and streamline the process of ordering coffee in a retail setting. By integrating a user-friendly frontend with a robust backend, the project aims to minimize wait times, reduce manual errors, and enhance the overall customer experience.

## 2. Goals
The primary goal of this project is to lay out the details of the Coffee Ordering System in a concise, easy-to-understand manner for clients, team members, and stakeholders.
- **Enhance Customer Convenience:** Provide a platform for remote ordering and payment.
- **Optimize Operations:** Automate order tracking and inventory management for staff.
- **Ensure Scalability:** Build a system architecture capable of handling growing user bases and transaction volumes.

## 3. Objectives
To achieve the stated goals, the following specific, measurable, and time-bound objectives were defined for the planning phase:
- **Frontend Development:** Develop a responsive, aesthetically pleasing customer interface using React.js that supports menu browsing, customization, and cart management. 
- **Backend Implementation:** Construct a secure RESTful API using Node.js and Express that handles user authentication (JWT), order processing, and database interactions with minimal latency.
- **Database Integrity:** Design and deploy a normalized MySQL database schema to ensure zero data redundancy and 100% transactional consistency for all orders.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensure the application is bug-free and meets all functional requirements through rigorous testing.

## 4. Expected Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the project, the following outcomes are anticipated:
- A fully functional, deployed web application accessible on desktop and mobile devices.
- Comprehensive documentation including user manuals and API references.
- A clear framework for future feature expansions such as loyalty programs or mobile app integration.
